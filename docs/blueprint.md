## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#77B5FE), evoking professionalism and technical expertise.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), providing a clean and modern backdrop.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BE29EC), used for highlights and calls to action, adding a spark of energy.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for titles and headings to create a techy, modern feel; body font: 'Inter' sans-serif for readability in descriptions and blog content.
- Use clear, minimalist icons related to engineering and technology, such as circuit diagrams, schematics, and tools. A consistent, outline style will complement the overall modern aesthetic.
- A clean, responsive layout using a grid system. Each section should have clear headings and concise content, and be easily accessible. Ensure it is mobile-friendly and adaptable across devices.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience. For example, smooth scrolling to sections, hover effects on project cards, and a loading animation to indicate progress, all provide a smooth, more polished look and feel.
