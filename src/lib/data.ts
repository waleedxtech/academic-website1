    title: 'Design and Development of Solid-state DC Circuit Breaker',
    shortDescription: 'Proposed and implemented a fast, low-loss solid-state DC circuit breaker with reclosing and rebreaking capabilities.',
    longDescription: 'Proposed a novel solid-state DC circuit breaker addressing control and stability challenges in DC power systems. It features low conduction loss, quick reclosing, and rebreaking capability. Operating modes and performance were verified through Simulink/MATLAB simulations. The breaker is designed to interrupt and clear faults within approximately 200 Âµs, significantly reducing potential damage. It also incorporated a recharging mechanism for the commutation capacitor, enabling rebreaking capability. This work was presented at an international conference.',
